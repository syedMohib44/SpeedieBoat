The Template project uses TextMeshPros default font.

To create a font with TextMeshPro ask Gav to provide you with a font, I put them in the source folder

Open the Window->TextMeshPro->FontAssetCreator

Drag the font in, check get kerning pairs for spacing and then hit Generate.

Save the font to the fonts folder which you can then drag onto TextMeshPro components.

If you want to change attributes other than vertex color and point size you will have to duplicate the font before doing so 
as other settings are on the material and will affect all components using that font.

Have fun!
